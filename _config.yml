  I'm Arnab, a math grad student at the University of Pittsburgh, researching computational neuroscience with Dr. Bard Ermentrout. I specialized in pure mathematics during my MSc at IISER Bhopal, focusing on Algebra and Number Theory. 
  Currently, I'm diving into data science and machine learning at CMU with Dr. Robert Kass. With experience teaching at several institutions, I've honed my teamwork and leadership skills. 
  I pride myself on patiently <mark>teaching calculus</mark> to students and <mark>expertly deboning Bengali fish</mark> dishes.

          It was my first project and many data science staff went over my head but I started getting interested.

          It was a poster presentation in a group and it was my first applied project. I did the data cleaning and visualization using tidyverse, Dplyr, and GGPlot hist and Corrplot. We tried to visualize the data to get an idea of how the cost of a house(dependent variable) depends on other factors e.g. 
          no of bedrooms, the population of the area, vacant units, etc. Motivated from here, I am trying to write a project on California house prices with some predictive modeling.

          This project was all about predicting when a machine is going to <mark>fail</mark> from the variable inputs. The main model we used here is logistic regression and we performed SVC at the end. In the general file I have given general introduction, performed EDA, cluster analysis, introduced different 
          models, analyzed their performance, and made predictions then as a Bonus we touched SVC and Neural Networks briefly.

          We are dealing with the population model and spiking model which are related by theta transformation and that is why the model is called by the name as theta model. We have shown the transformation calculation in particular. Then we wanted to find out a particular impulse through which we can jump between 
          higher and lower oscillations. The challenge was that we were dealing with a large population of neurons and that is why we had to start with the case study and bifurcation diagram. We got some ideas and I managed to find good parameters so that the neurons behave as we wanted in 9D then we extended the 
          case to the population of neurons and the system responded correctly. Now we were trying to summarise the result. Theta neuron model has application in visual cortex and also in Parkinson's disease as we noticed delayed beta oscillation in Parkinson which can be studied using theta model.

          Founded by Hugh Henry Brackenridge as Pittsburgh Academy in 1787, the University of Pittsburgh is one of the few universities and colleges established in the 18th century in the United States. It is the oldest continuously chartered institution 
          of learning in the U.S. west of the Allegheny Mountains. Now the 132-acre Pittsburgh campus includes various historic buildings that are part of the Schenley Farms Historic District, most notably its 42-story Gothic revival centerpiece, the Cathedral of Learning.

          I have shifted my interest to applied math and started working on computational neuroscience as I wanted to contribute to a real-world problem. I have neurological diseases in my family which gave me the motivation to choose this path.
          
          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of administrative clubs like Graduate student organizations and Graduate and Professional Student Government taking on roles such as GPSG representative, chair of diversity board, and Summer research funding committee.

              Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) were created in 2006 through a proclamation of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, under the category of institutes of national importance, to promote quality education and research 
              in basic sciences. Soon after the announcement, two of these institutes at Pune and Kolkata, respectively, were started in 2006. This was followed by institutes at Mohali (2007), Bhopal and Thiruvananthapuram (2008), Tirupati (2015) and Berhampur (2016). Each IISER is a degree granting autonomous institution with a prime focus to integrate science, education and research.

          I have studied pure math while focusing on algebra and analysis. I got interested in numbers. All of my reading projects were on algebraic and analytic number theory, modular forms and elliptic curves. I met some really
          good teachers who were pure mathematicians.
          
          I spent a lot of my free time as a social worker teaching village kids in a nearby villa named Bhauri.
